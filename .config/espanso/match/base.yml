# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Simple text replacement
  - trigger: ":espanso"
    replace: "Hi there!"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ";shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"

  # And much more! For more information, visit the docs: https://espanso.org/docs/
  - trigger: ";lh"
    replace: "/lgtm \nGiving others a chance to review as well, feel free to unhold\n/hold"

  - trigger: ";creview"
    replace: "I could use a review on "

  - trigger: ";mreview"
    replace: "May I have a review for "


  - trigger: ";time"
    replace: "{{mytime}}"
    vars:
      - name: mytime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "[%H:%M]"

  - regex: ";(?P<smart>.*);"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "date -d \"{{smart}}\" +%F"

  - trigger: "rwha"
    replace: "rhwa"

  - trigger: "duedate"
    replace: "\U0001F4C5"
